PROJECT TITLE:
MyNote

DESCRIPTION:
MyNote is a note/diary app with built-in password protection and organizational features. It will allow users to create diary entries/notes in text and stores them securely behind a password. The notes will feature a timestamp and can be viewed through the app at any time- assuming the user inputs the correct password into the app, which they can set themselves. 
While you won't need a password to open the app itself, the user will have the ability to create folders containing entries within the app that are protected. Each individual folder can be set to use a different password, or be free to enter. This way, the user can organise their notes in to their convenience.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The user must be able to make diary entries/notes
- The user must be able to create folders and subfolders to organize their notes
- The user must be able to protect individual folders/notes with a password
- The user must be able to view past notes
- The user must be able to edit folders and notes
- The user must be able to delete folders and notes
- The user must be able to save images and files inside of folders
- The app's data must be encrypted to prevent access to valuable information through the file manager
- The app must automatically lock when it is closed or when the power button is pressed to prevent the user from accidentally leaving it unlocked
- The app must have a settings menu where the user can configure how the app works
- The app must have an "emergency delete" button in the settings menu that clears all entries when pressed
